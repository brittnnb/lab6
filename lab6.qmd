#Question 1 ANSWER:According to the CAMELS dataset documentation, zero_q_freq represents the fraction of time during which streamflow is zero for a given basin or site. This is important for understanding the behavior of the streamflow over time and can be used to identify basins that experience dry conditions or intermittent flow.
